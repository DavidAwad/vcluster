## Contributing

Feel free to take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/DavidAwad/vcluster/issues) page for the scattered reminders of what I wanted to do for the project.



I love Pull Requests, just please follow PEP8. They all run through travis, so they need to pass of course.


If you see anything horribly wrong please feel free to let me know. Thanks!
